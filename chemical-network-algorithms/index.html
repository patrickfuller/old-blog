          <h2>Chemical Network Algorithms</h2>
<p class="meta">03 Sep 2012</p>

<div class="post">
<p>Our lab recently got three papers published in a single issue of Angewandte Chemie
about our work incorporating graph theory into chemistry (<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201202155/abstract">here</a>,
<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201202209/abstract">here</a>, and
<a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/anie.201202210/abstract">here</a>!).
Among these was my first first-author paper, which is a biggish deal in the science
world. So, that&#39;s exciting.</p>

<p>Although the three papers address different issues, their underlying approaches
are very similar. By viewing chemistry as a connected network, we can imagine
algorithms that &quot;traverse&quot; reactions. In my head, this is nothing more than the
merging of two popular fields. In fact, I was originally surprised that there was
so little on the topic - especially with the growth of cheminformatics over recent
years. However, I&#39;ve come to find that synthetic chemistry is an astoundingly
conservative field, and people are slow to adopt technologies out of their expertise.
Either that, or I&#39;m terrible at doing lit searches. Probably both.</p>

<p>First, let&#39;s discuss chemistry as a connected network. You often see reactions
written as <em>A + B -&gt; C + D</em>, which is useful in showcasing a single reaction. But
what if you want to show multiple reactions? The standard notation falls apart
rather quickly, and most chemists will find that they&#39;ll start drawing arrows
differently. In fact, I&#39;d argue that most chemists already view complex sets of
a reactions as a network - they just never had a term for it.</p>

<p>As an example, let&#39;s take a set of related reactions and write them out in standard
notation.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><code class="text language-text" data-lang="text">B + E -&gt; F + G
D + H -&gt; I + J
F + J -&gt; K
I + J -&gt; L + M
K + M -&gt; N
N + E -&gt; G
</code></pre></div>
<p>The letters are all placeholders for chemical formulas, which I&#39;m leaving out
for simplicity. It&#39;s short and concise, but this representation doesn&#39;t show how
the reactions interconnect. In network representation, this would look like:</p>

<p><img src="/img/network.png" alt=""></p>

<p>Here, the green circle nodes represent chemicals and the black diamonds represent
reactions. I added in the black diamonds to simplify arrows, so it&#39;s easier to
see how the chemicals react with each other.</p>

<p>I think that many chemists already sketch synthetic routes like this. Starting
from simple precursors like ethanol, work your way to a target chemical. You&#39;ll
have arrows pointing everywhere, with your thought process based around a carbon
backbone. Once you think of chemistry in this manner, everything else in these
papers is very logical.</p>

<p>In two of the papers, we discuss methods for algorithmically generating synthetic
routes to targets. By finding a way to score chemicals and reactions, we can optimize
routes. In fact, this &quot;scoring&quot; is the only real difference between the papers.</p>

<p>There&#39;s still a lot of work to be done in this area, but I think that the current
algorithms already provide evidence of the efficacy of the network approach. If we
can automate and simplify the more repetitive portions of synthetic route discovery,
we can give chemists more time to, well, do chemistry.</p>
