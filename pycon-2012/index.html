<p>Last month, I was able to go to PyCon, a conference on the Python programming language
in Santa Clara. In short, it was amazing.</p>

<p>In particular, I want to talk about the Python community. They are the nicest,
most helpful people I&#39;ve ever met! The talks were amazing, and everyone was so
open about everything they were doing. Everyone was approachable, and were friendly
for friendliness&#39; sake. There were no ulterior motives in any conversation; people
were genuinely interested in each others&#39; work and wanted to help for the sake
of helping.</p>

<p>To me, it was a stark contrast to the science conferences that compose my past experiences.
Even though science is supposed to be open, there&#39;s constant paranoia about people
stealing each others&#39; ideas. &quot;Don&#39;t put too much on that poster&quot;, &quot;Don&#39;t let anyone
take pictures of your presentation&quot;, &quot;Make sure to not give away any details until
we publish!&quot;. And, man, are people pompous in science. There&#39;s always that one guy
- if you&#39;ve been to a scientific conference, you&#39;ve surely met him. The guy who
feels compelled to assert his intellectual superiority through <em>any</em> means
available. If he&#39;s giving a talk, he&#39;s commenting on the incompetence of everyone
else in his field. If he&#39;s in the audience, he&#39;s asking questions tangentially
    related to the talk in an attempt to show off to the presenter.</p>

<p>I&#39;m a programming proselyte. I legitimately <em>want</em> to help out the community.
I&#39;ve always liked science for its overarching goals: cure disease, save the planet,
help humanity. But, I like coding for the people. New life goal: figure out how
to get the best of both worlds.</p>

<p>I&#39;ll leave you with some of my favorite PyCon talks.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>David Beazley&#39;s keynote on PyPy.</h4>

<p>On top of being an interesting topic, his talk
showcases the aforementioned difference between the science and coding communities.
He&#39;s also a Chicago local. Awesome.</p>

<p>Actually, all of the keynotes were great. Seriously, watch all of them.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>Unicode and string encodings.</h4>

<p>This topic is overlooked by almost everyone for the
same reason- it&#39;s so damn boring. In &quot;Pragmatic Unicode, or, How Do I Stop the Pain?&quot;,
Ned Batchelder takes the best approach possible. He admits the topic is boring,
and gets straight to the parts that people care about without getting too didactic
about the topic.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<h4>Data, Design, Meaning.</h4>

<p>One big difference between talks at PyCon and talks in science is aesthetics.
Namely, in science, there is none. In fact, scientists seem to prefer obfuscated
graphs and text-laden powerpoints. If you&#39;re one of those said scientists, please
watch this.</p>
